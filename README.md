# UnityMazes
A library of maze generation algorithms, and maze renderers for Unity. The maze generation classes can be used with any C# project. I enjoy making mazes and maze algorithms, so please let me know what cool stuff you make with this!

This code uses features of C# 6. To make your Unity projects compatible with this code, follow this link:

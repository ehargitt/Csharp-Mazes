# Csharp-Mazes
A library of maze generation algorithms for C#. Here is a [screenshot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/flzl4dse9uocvv4/maze_screenshot.jpg?dl=0) of it in action using Unity. I enjoy making mazes and maze algorithms, so please let me know what cool stuff you make with this!

This library target .NET 3.5, so it can be used with UnityEngine.

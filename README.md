# Csharp-Mazes
A library of maze generation algorithms for C#. Here is a [screenshot](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AjsYjEgx93fhgdptGv1Q9BMDBodk-Q) of it in action using Unity. I enjoy making mazes and maze algorithms, so please let me know what cool stuff you make with this!

This library target .NET 3.5, so it can be used with UnityEngine.
